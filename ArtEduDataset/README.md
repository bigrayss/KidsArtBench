# Dataset Files

This directory contains the processed annotation files used in our experiments.

- `train.csv`: Training split containing artwork annotations and labels.
- `test.csv`: Test split used for evaluation.
- `grade.csv`: Student grade information associated with the artworks.

Raw artwork images are not included in this directory. Once access to the images is granted, the image files can be extracted into the `images/` subdirectory.
